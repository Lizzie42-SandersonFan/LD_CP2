# LD 1st Personal Project, Movie Recomender

# REQUIREMENTS
    # A main function that runs the program and shows a persistent menu.
    # A parser function to load and normalize the provided movie list (CSV) into structured records.
    # Separate filter functions for: genre, director, actor(s), and length.
    # A function that combines selected filters (AND logic by default) and returns matching movies.
    # A function to pretty-print results and a function to print the full movie list.
    # Input validation and helpful error messages; handle missing or malformed movie records gracefully.
    # Allow interactive entry of filter values and length ranges (min/max or comparator).

# HINTS
    # Normalize text to lower-case and trim whitespace for case-insensitive matching.
    # Store multi-valued fields (genres, actors) as lists and match if any element contains the query term.
    # Implement length filtering with min and/or max values (support <, > comparators optionally).
    # If zero matches, suggest relaxing or removing one filter.
    # Provide a small sample movies file in the repo and include unit tests for filter logic.

# FILTER RULES CLARIFICATION
    # Matching is case-insensitive.
    # For genres and actors, match if any element contains the query substring (trim whitespace).
    # Length filter accepts min and/or max (integers). If only one provided, use it as bound.
    # Combine multiple filters using logical AND (movie must satisfy every selected filter).
    # If a movie is missing a field, it does not match a filter for that field.
