# LD 1st Personal Library Program

# OVERVIEW
# Create a program that allows user to manage a personal library catalog for any ONE type (books, movies, music, etc). The project needs to allow users to add new items, display ALL contents, search for a specific item (by title, author/artist/director), remove a book from the library, exit the program. 

# STEPS
# Stores all items in a list
# Function to add a new item
# Function to search the items
# Function to remove an item
# Function that runs the code (displays the menu options inside and calls the functions inside of a while True loop)
# Project must include
    # easy to understand variable and function names
    # Pseudocode comments explaining what the code is doing
    # Good use of white space to keep items separate and easy to read/find
